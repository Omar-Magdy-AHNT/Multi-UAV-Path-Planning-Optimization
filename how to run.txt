in the code files there are variables that can be edited which are 
numdrones for the number of drones/vehicles 
numtrackp for number of trackpoints of the path for each drone/vehicle
also there is an obstacle number variable (obsnum) which is randomie
dsafe is the safety distance between the drone/vehicle and the obstacles
the output array is the output of the optimization is done on the problem 

Methods made:

1) createobs()

this method creates obsnum random obstacle locations in our grid

2) createarray()

which creates an array with all the drones/vehicles start and endpoints and their trackpoints [sp1,tps1,ep1,sp2,tps2,ep2, . . . . . , spn,tpsn,epn]

3)func1()

it is the first objective function which is the summation of all the distances between the track points of each drone/vehicle

4)func2() is the danger objective function

5)contraint1() which is the first constraint function of the horizontal turning angle

6) constraint2() which is the constraint of the vertical turning angle
NEW

7) constraint3() which is the object collision constraint


this is an example of the prints of the code
